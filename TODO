In loose order of priority:


* Come up with a way to rank comments. Which are most informative? For now, just use most dugg/upvoted, etc.
* memcache results of /top
* check if updated within TTL. If not, send message to fetch. How do we account for duplicate requests?
* How many times, or what logic should I use to redirect? nytimes brings me to login page. maybe only follow 301s
