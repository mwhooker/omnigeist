In loose order of priority:


* Come up with a way to rank comments. Which are most informative? For now, just use most dugg/upvoted, etc.
* memcache results of /top
* check if updated within TTL. If not, send message to fetch.
    * How do we account for duplicate requests?
    * will need to check for errors more carefully
* How many times, or what logic should I use to redirect? nytimes brings me to login page. maybe only follow 301s
* Probably use bookmarklet to display comments. Need to make bookmarklet compiler. Figure out when in the dev cycle this should be run
