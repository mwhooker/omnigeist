In loose order of priority:


* return fat json result. i.e. 100 comments from each provider. 
    look at url structure like:
        /top?url= (CHECK)
        /top/[digg, reddit]?url=
        params:
            pagination of some sort.
* How many times, or what logic should I use to redirect? nytimes brings me to login page. maybe only follow 301s
* use buildout to do string replacement on js templates. also minify
* Come up with a way to rank comments. Which are most informative? For now, just use most dugg/upvoted, etc.
* HTTP caching semantics around top endpoint
* Write input validation for API. i.e. validate URL, numbers, etc.
* should monitor tweets of people a user follows for comments on URLs

X figure out how to poll taskqueue so we can keep client connection open (channels) while we fetch the result the first time. For now just running fanout inline
